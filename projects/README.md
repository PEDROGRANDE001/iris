# Project Management System

**Managed by Iris** — these files are the source of truth for Higney International project tracking.

## Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `TRACKER.md` | Master project tracker — all active/pending projects with status, phase, next actions, values |
| `TASKS.md` | Active task board organized by owner — what needs doing and by whom |

## How It Works
- Updated daily by Iris based on conversations, emails, and CRM activity
- Complements (does not replace) Monday.com for detailed work management
- Pull requests, corrections, and additions via Telegram to Peter/Iris

## Related Context
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — Daily notes and raw logs
- `MEMORY.md` — Long-term curated context
- `memory/drive-*.md` — Google Drive digests
- `memory/cloze-contacts-summary.md` — CRM contact overview
