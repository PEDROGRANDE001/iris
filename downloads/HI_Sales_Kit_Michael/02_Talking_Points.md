# Michael's Talking Points — Higney International

## The 10-Second Pitch
"Higney International is the only hospitality FF&E firm where the founder actually ran the venues — 25 years operating Nikki Beach globally. We design outdoor hospitality spaces, manufacture our own furniture line, and deliver everything. One team, concept to delivery."

## The 30-Second Version
"Most FF&E firms either design or procure — we do both, plus we manufacture our own furniture line called Liora. But what really sets us apart is that our founder Peter Higney spent 25 years as COO of Nikki Beach, running 12 beach clubs and hotels on 4 continents. So when we design a pool deck or beach club, we're not guessing how it operates — we've lived it. That means better layouts, smarter material choices, and spaces that actually generate revenue, not just look good in a rendering."

## Key Messages (Memorize These)

### 1. "We've operated what we design."
Most designers have never worked a shift at a pool deck. Peter ran 12 of them globally. We know where the server station needs to go, how towel service flows, and why that gorgeous daybed placement will actually kill your F&B revenue.

### 2. "One relationship, not five."
Typical hotel renovation: hire a designer, hire a procurement firm, source 10 furniture vendors, coordinate shipping from 6 countries. With us: one team handles concept, furniture (from our own Liora line), procurement of everything else, and delivery.

### 3. "We make the furniture."
Our Liora line is manufactured in Indonesia, Turkey, France, and Vietnam. 12+ collections. That means better margins for you, faster lead times, and quality control we own from sketch to shipping container. We're not marking up someone else's catalog.

### 4. "Luxury quality, not luxury-brand pricing."
We source from the same regions as Dedon and Kettal, but without the brand premium. A director's chair from our network: $35-45. Same quality from a name brand: $200+. Same pool deck, very different project budget.

### 5. "We don't install — and that's intentional."
We ship everything to your door, organized and labeled. Installation is handled by your GC or our trusted partners. This keeps our costs down and your flexibility up.

## Objection Handling

**"We already have a designer."**
→ "Great — we work alongside designers all the time. Where we add value is the manufacturing and procurement side. Your designer specs the vision, we supply the furniture from our Liora line and handle the full FF&E package. Or if it's outdoor/pool — that's where we really shine on the design side."

**"We usually go direct to manufacturers."**
→ "Makes sense for some pieces. But when you're coordinating 15 vendors across 4 countries for a pool deck refit, someone needs to own the whole picture. We do that — and since we manufacture our own line, you're getting factory-direct pricing on the core furniture anyway."

**"You're a small firm."**
→ "By design. Peter personally touches every project. You're not getting handed off to a junior designer. And our manufacturing network can handle scale — we've furnished Nikki Beach properties from Miami to Marbella to Koh Samui."

**"What's your minimum project size?"**
→ "We're flexible. We've done $5K restaurant refreshes and $1.8M hotel FF&E packages. The sweet spot is $50K-$500K outdoor hospitality projects — pool decks, beach clubs, resort restaurants."

**"How are you different from Brown Jordan / Tuuci / Dedon?"**
→ "They sell furniture. We design the entire space and then furnish it — including our own line plus whatever else the project needs. They're a product catalog. We're a full-service partner."

## Who to Target

### Ideal Clients
- **Hotel ownership groups** renovating outdoor/pool areas
- **Resort GMs** upgrading beach clubs or pool decks
- **Restaurant groups** with outdoor dining programs
- **Architects/designers** who need an FF&E partner (especially outdoor)
- **Property developers** with hospitality components

### Best Entry Point
The outdoor space. Interior FF&E is crowded. **Pool decks, beach clubs, rooftop bars, resort restaurants** — that's where we have zero real competition.

### Qualifying Questions
1. "Are you planning any outdoor space renovations in the next 12 months?"
2. "Who's handling your FF&E procurement currently?"
3. "Have you been happy with how your outdoor furniture has held up?"
4. "Do you have a designer for the project, or are you looking for end-to-end?"
