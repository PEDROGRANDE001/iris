## Template A: Hotel / Resort GM (Outdoor Renovation)

**Subject:** Your pool deck is leaving money on the table

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out from Higney International — we design and furnish outdoor hospitality spaces for luxury hotels and resorts.

What makes us different: our founder Peter Higney spent 25 years as COO of Nikki Beach, operating 12 beach clubs and hotels worldwide. So when we design a pool area, we're drawing on real operational experience — not just aesthetics.

We also manufacture our own outdoor furniture line (Liora), so we handle everything from concept through delivery. One team, no middlemen.

We're currently working with properties like the Ritz-Carlton Bal Harbour and Four Seasons Costa Rica. If [Property Name] has any outdoor renovations on the horizon, I'd love to show you what we do.

Worth a quick call?

## Template B: Architect / Interior Designer (Partnership)

**Subject:** Outdoor FF&E partner — we make the furniture

Hi [Name],

I know finding the right FF&E partner for outdoor/hospitality projects can be a headache — too many vendors, too many lead times, too many things that look great in a catalog and fall apart after one season.

We might be able to simplify that. Higney International designs and manufactures outdoor hospitality furniture (our Liora line — teak, aluminum, French-made sun loungers). We work alongside architects and designers as the outdoor FF&E specialist — you own the vision, we supply the product and handle procurement.

Our founder ran Nikki Beach for 25 years, so we bring an operator's perspective to material selection and layout that most furniture companies can't.

Would you be open to a quick intro? Happy to send our lookbook.

## Template C: Property Developer (New Build)

**Subject:** FF&E for [Project Name] — from the team behind Nikki Beach

Hi [Name],

If [Project Name] includes any outdoor hospitality components — pool deck, restaurant terrace, beach club, rooftop — I'd like to introduce Higney International.

We're a design-to-delivery FF&E firm specializing in luxury outdoor hospitality. We design the space, manufacture furniture through our own Liora line (4 countries, 12+ collections), and deliver the complete package.

Our founder Peter Higney built and operated the Nikki Beach brand globally for 25 years — 12 venues across 4 continents. That operational DNA shows up in every layout we design.

Current projects include the Ritz-Carlton Bal Harbour pool renovation, Four Seasons Papagayo, and Metro Lagoons.

Happy to send our portfolio or jump on a call.

## Follow-Up Template (Day 5)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [Name],

Just circling back on this. If the timing isn't right, no worries at all — but if outdoor FF&E is something you'll need in the next 6-12 months, we'd love to be on your radar.

Happy to send our Liora lookbook in the meantime — no commitment, just good furniture.
