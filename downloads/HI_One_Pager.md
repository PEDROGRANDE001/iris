## About

Higney International provides comprehensive interior design and FF&E (furniture, fixtures & equipment) procurement services for luxury hospitality properties worldwide. Founded by Peter Higney — the creative force behind the Nikki Beach brand — we bring over 75 years of combined global hospitality experience to every project.

We offer two core services, together or independently: **Design** and **Fulfillment**. Clients engage us for the full journey — concept through installation — or for either discipline on its own.

## Why Higney International

**Design that drives revenue.** There's a gulf between design intent and operational efficiency. Most designers have never run a venue. Peter Higney spent 25 years doing both — designing the Nikki Beach brand, then operating 12 beach clubs and hotels as COO across four continents. That means every layout, every material choice, every furniture spec is informed by what actually moves the needle: table turns, covers per shift, service flow, revenue per square foot. Design should complement operations, not fight them.

**One team, concept through installation.** We eliminate the gap between what's designed and what arrives on-site. No hand-offs between firms, no lost intent, no surprises. Or engage us for design or procurement independently.

**Built for hospitality, not just aesthetics.** We know what survives sun, salt, rain, and 200 covers a night — and what pays for itself.
