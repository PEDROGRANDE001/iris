**Email:** al@baraondadesenzano.it
**Company:** Baraonda (Desenzano, Italy)
**Hook:** European hospitality venue — HI has manufacturing partners in France, Turkey, Indonesia

**Subject:** Outdoor FF&E — From Concept to Delivery

Dear Lidozzi,

I'm Peter Higney, founder of Higney International. After 25 years operating Nikki Beach — from designing the brand to running 12 beach clubs and hotels worldwide — I started HI to solve a problem I lived every day: the gap between what designers envision and what actually works in a hospitality environment.

We handle outdoor FF&E end-to-end — concept through manufacturing and delivery — with a network of premium manufacturers across Europe and Southeast Asia. Having operated venues from Saint-Tropez to Marbella, I understand the European market's standards for quality and aesthetics.

If you're planning any outdoor renovations or new builds, I'd welcome a conversation about how we can help.

**Email:** mestevez@puntacana.com
**Company:** Punta Cana (Dominican Republic)
**Hook:** Caribbean resort — HI has direct Caribbean experience from Nikki Beach operations

**Subject:** Outdoor FF&E for Caribbean Hospitality

Dear Angelle,

I'm Peter Higney, founder of Higney International. I spent 25 years at Nikki Beach — designing the brand and running beach clubs and hotels across the Caribbean, Mediterranean, and beyond. That operational experience is what sets us apart from typical FF&E firms.

We design and source outdoor furniture, cabanas, umbrellas, and custom pieces end-to-end — from concept through manufacturing and delivery. Our manufacturing network spans Indonesia, Vietnam, Turkey, and France, giving us both quality range and competitive pricing.

Currently, we're working with properties like the Ritz-Carlton Bal Harbour on full outdoor renovations. If Punta Cana has any upcoming outdoor projects, I'd love to explore how we can help.

### 3. Anthony Frunzi
**Email:** anthony.frunzi@fairmont.com
**Company:** Fairmont Hotels
**Hook:** Major luxury hotel brand — speak to brand standards and scale

**Subject:** Outdoor FF&E — An Operator's Perspective

Dear Anthony,

I'm Peter Higney, founder of Higney International. Before starting HI, I spent 25 years at Nikki Beach — from designing the brand to serving as COO of Nikki Beach Hotels & Resorts, operating 12 venues across 3 continents.

That operational background is our differentiator. Most FF&E firms design beautiful spaces but have never run a single venue. We understand how furniture holds up through a season, how cabana layouts affect service flow, and why the wrong umbrella costs you more in replacements than the right one saves upfront.

We handle everything from concept through manufacturing and delivery, working with premium manufacturers worldwide. Currently executing a full outdoor renovation at the Ritz-Carlton Bal Harbour.

If Fairmont has any outdoor projects on the horizon, I'd welcome a conversation.

Dear Brandon,

I'm Peter Higney, founder of Higney International. After 25 years operating Nikki Beach — designing the brand, running beach clubs and hotels worldwide, and overseeing every outdoor renovation along the way — I started HI to bring an operator's lens to FF&E procurement.

For developers, that means we understand not just aesthetics but durability, maintenance costs, and how design choices impact operating margins. We handle outdoor FF&E end-to-end — concept through manufacturing and delivery — with a manufacturing network that gives us both quality and competitive pricing.

If MDEVCO has any hospitality projects with outdoor components, I'd welcome a conversation.

Dear Brian,

I'm Peter Higney, founder of Higney International. I spent 25 years at Nikki Beach — from designing the brand to leading operations across 12 beach clubs and hotels on 3 continents. That hands-on experience is what drives everything we do at HI.

We specialize in outdoor FF&E for hospitality — cabanas, poolside furniture, umbrellas, custom pieces — handling everything from design concept through manufacturing and delivery. Our manufacturing network spans Indonesia, Vietnam, Turkey, and France.

What makes us different: we've actually operated the spaces we design for. We know what lasts, what guests respond to, and what creates revenue versus just looking good in renderings.

If any properties in your portfolio have outdoor renovations or new builds planned, I'd welcome a conversation.

Dear Brian,

I'm Peter Higney, founder of Higney International. After 25 years at Nikki Beach — where I designed the brand and ran operations across 12 global venues — I started HI to bring an operator's perspective to hospitality FF&E.

We handle outdoor furniture, cabanas, and custom pieces from concept through manufacturing and delivery. The difference is we've lived with the consequences of design decisions — we know which materials last in coastal environments, which layouts maximize revenue per square foot, and how to balance aesthetics with operational reality.

Currently working with the Ritz-Carlton Bal Harbour on a full outdoor renovation. If The Kaufman Companies has any hospitality properties with outdoor needs, I'd love to connect.

**Company:** Meliá Hotels International
**Hook:** Major hotel chain — speak to scale and brand standards across properties

**Subject:** Outdoor FF&E — From One Operator to Another

Dear Alex,

I'm Peter Higney, founder of Higney International. Before starting HI, I spent 25 years at Nikki Beach — designing the brand and operating 12 beach clubs and hotels across the Mediterranean, Caribbean, and Asia.

I know Meliá's portfolio well. Managing outdoor spaces across multiple properties and climates is a unique challenge — durability requirements vary, guest expectations differ by market, and procurement at scale demands both quality and cost control.

That's exactly what we do. HI handles outdoor FF&E from concept through manufacturing and delivery, with a manufacturing network across Indonesia, Vietnam, Turkey, and France. We also design under our own brand, Liora & Co, for properties wanting exclusive collections.

I'd welcome a conversation about how we might support Meliá's outdoor projects.

We handle everything from design concept through manufacturing and delivery, working with premium manufacturers in France, Turkey, Indonesia, and Vietnam. For European luxury properties, we understand the standards — both aesthetic and durability — that the market demands.

Dear Fonteini,

I'm Peter Higney, founder of Higney International. I spent 25 years at Nikki Beach, operating venues across the Mediterranean including some of the most demanding outdoor environments in hospitality.

I know what Mykonos requires — furniture that handles salt air and wind, looks impeccable for the season, and can be refreshed efficiently. We handle outdoor FF&E end-to-end, from concept through manufacturing and delivery, with manufacturers in Europe and Southeast Asia.

If you're planning any updates to Amazon Mykonos, I'd love to connect.

Dear Andrew,

I'm Peter Higney, founder of Higney International. After 25 years at Nikki Beach — where I designed the brand and led operations across 12 venues on 3 continents — I started HI to bring real operational experience to FF&E procurement.

Most FF&E firms can design a beautiful pool deck. Few have actually managed one through a full season, dealt with warranty claims on furniture that didn't hold up, or redesigned a cabana layout because the original killed service efficiency. We have.

We handle outdoor FF&E from concept through manufacturing and delivery, working with premium manufacturers worldwide. Currently executing a full outdoor renovation at the Ritz-Carlton Bal Harbour.

If Hilton has any resort properties with outdoor projects on the horizon, I'd welcome a conversation.

We're doing some exciting work — currently renovating the outdoor spaces at the Ritz-Carlton Bal Harbour, among other projects. We handle everything from concept through manufacturing and delivery, with our own furniture brand Liora & Co.

If any properties in your world need outdoor FF&E, I'd love to talk. Nobody knows what Nikki Beach-level outdoor spaces require better than we do.

South Florida's outdoor challenges are something we live with daily — UV exposure, salt air, rain, hurricanes. We know what materials and designs hold up, and we source accordingly.

Dear Arnau,

I'm Peter Higney, founder of Higney International. After 25 years at Nikki Beach — designing the brand and operating 12 venues across 3 continents — I started HI to help hospitality properties maximize the ROI of their outdoor spaces.

Outdoor areas are increasingly the primary revenue drivers for resort properties, yet most FF&E procurement ignores operational realities. We bring an operator's perspective: we know which investments drive guest satisfaction and revenue, and which are just expensive photos for the brochure.

We handle outdoor FF&E from concept through manufacturing and delivery. If Blueport's portfolio includes hospitality properties with outdoor opportunities, I'd welcome a conversation.

After 25 years operating Nikki Beach venues worldwide, I bring an unusual perspective: I've lived with the consequences of every design decision in outdoor hospitality. That means we can help bridge the gap between design intent and operational reality.

Dear Arianna,

I'm Peter Higney, founder of Higney International. I've admired WATG's work for years — having spent 25 years at Nikki Beach operating venues in many of the same markets you design for.

That operational background is what sets us apart as an FF&E partner. We've managed the outdoor spaces, dealt with the durability failures, and redesigned the layouts that didn't work. Now we bring that knowledge to the design and procurement side.

We handle outdoor FF&E from concept through manufacturing and delivery, working with premium manufacturers worldwide. We also design under our own brand, Liora & Co, for properties wanting exclusive collections.

I'd love to explore how HI might complement WATG's projects as a specification and procurement partner for outdoor spaces.
