Dear Giuseppe and Jason,

Thank you for the quotation on the Mahoney cabana project. We met with the clients and have the following feedback and requests:

**Client Feedback:**
- They love the bronze color
- They would like a fan installed inside the cabana
- They would like perimeter lighting included

**Additional Requests:**
1. Please confirm the manufacturing timeline — delivery is needed by the last week of April / first week of May
2. Does the quoted price include delivery to Parrish, Florida?
3. Installation will be bolting directly into concrete — no permits or engineering required
4. **New quote request:** Please provide pricing for **2 × 20ft × 20ft cabanas** in addition to the current scope

Please let us know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
Iris Reed
Office Assistant | Higney International
