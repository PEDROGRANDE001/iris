## About — Design Informed by Operations

Peter Higney founded Higney International after 25 years in global hospitality — designing, building, and operating venues across four continents. He created the Nikki Beach brand, then ran 12 beach clubs and hotels worldwide as COO before rising to VP of Hotel Development.

That operational DNA is what separates HI from every other design firm. Every layout, material choice, and furniture specification is informed by what actually drives revenue: table turns, covers per shift, service flow, and the guest experience.

> "Creating venues that evoke an emotional response through their aesthetics is what drives us in pursuit of perfection."
> — Peter Higney, Founder & CEO

## Services — Design

From initial concept to final specifications — we create spaces that perform operationally, not just aesthetically. Every decision is rooted in how venues actually run.

**Scope Analysis** — On-site assessment, FF&E audit, pricing & market analysis, and value engineering to establish a clear project roadmap.

**Schematic Design** — Mood boards, floor plans, material palettes, and preliminary FF&E selections that align design intent with operational goals.

**Design Development** — Photorealistic renderings, model rooms, tagged floor plans, and final selections — coordinated with architects and ownership teams.

**Specification & Documentation** — Complete FF&E spec books, bills of quantity, and RFQ-ready packages with formal stakeholder approval at each gate.

## Services — Fulfillment & Procurement

From purchase order to delivery — we source it, buy it, and ship it. Direct manufacturer relationships across the US, Europe, Vietnam, and Indonesia ensure premium quality at the best possible value.

**Global Sourcing** — Direct relationships with leading manufacturers and trusted factories worldwide — eliminating middlemen and maximizing value.

**Purchasing & Trust Management** — Dedicated trust accounts with transparent monthly reconciliation. Every dollar tracked, every purchase documented.

**Logistics Coordination** — Freight, customs brokerage, and delivery management. Warehousing and installation coordinated through trusted partners.

**Construction Administration** — Shop drawing review, sample approvals, RFI management, site visits, and punch list — ensuring design intent survives installation.

## Services — Custom Fabrication

When off-the-shelf won't do, we design and manufacture bespoke pieces to your exact specifications. From concept sketches through sampling, material testing, and production — every piece is built to distinguish your venue in a competitive market.

We work with certified manufacturing partners who meet our standards for quality, durability, and craftsmanship. Every custom piece goes through rigorous sampling and approval before production begins.

**The result: furniture and fixtures that exist nowhere else — designed for your space, your brand, your operations.**
