# Higney International — Competitive Landscape Analysis
*February 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

Higney International occupies a rare position in hospitality FF&E: **design + owned manufacturing line + 25 years of venue operations experience**. Most competitors deliver one or two of these. Nobody we've found combines all three at HI's level — particularly in the luxury outdoor/beach club niche.

## Competitor Profiles

### Tier 1: Large Hospitality Design Firms

**Hirsch Bedner Associates (HBA)**
- **What:** World's largest hospitality interior design firm. ~1,000+ employees globally.
- **Revenue:** ~$14M (design fees — doesn't include client spend on FF&E)
- **Strengths:** Brand recognition, global offices, work with every major hotel brand (Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton, Waldorf Astoria). Massive portfolio.
- **Weaknesses:** No manufacturing. No operational experience. Interior-focused — outdoor/pool deck is afterthought. Expensive. Slow. Corporate. A $50M hotel renovation, not a $500K beach club.
- **Threat to HI:** Low. Different weight class and focus. HBA won't touch a boutique beach club or pool deck renovation.

**EDG Design (San Francisco/Dallas/Singapore)**
- **What:** Hospitality design + branding studio. Strategy, concept, FF&E sourcing.
- **Strengths:** Strong branding integration (not just furniture — the whole story). Good restaurant/chef-driven projects.
- **Weaknesses:** No manufacturing. West Coast bias. Less outdoor/resort focus.
- **Threat to HI:** Low-medium. Could overlap on resort restaurant projects.

### Tier 2: FF&E Procurement Specialists (Design-Adjacent)

**Benjamin West (Louisville, CO)**
- **What:** Pure FF&E/OS&E purchasing and project management. Founded 1998. ~100-200 employees.
- **Revenue:** $16-21M
- **Strengths:** Process-driven. Budget management. Vendor networks. Trusted by hotel brands for large-scale procurement.
- **Weaknesses:** No design. No manufacturing. No creative vision — they execute specs others create. No outdoor/beach specialization.
- **Threat to HI:** Low. They're the logistics layer. HI could actually partner with firms like this on large projects.

**Carver & Associates**
- **What:** FF&E/OS&E procurement. Acquired Jaguar Hospitality Services in 2025.
- **Strengths:** Growing through acquisition. US luxury market focus.
- **Weaknesses:** Same as Benjamin West — procurement only.
- **Threat to HI:** Low.

**Avendra / BirchStreet / Sigma Sourcing**
- **What:** Technology-driven procurement platforms for hotel chains.
- **Relevance to HI:** Zero. These are enterprise supply chain tools for Marriotts and Hiltons managing thousands of properties. Different universe.

### Tier 3: Design + Manufacturing (Closest Competitors)

**Curve Hospitality (Houston, TX)**
- **What:** Design, manufacturing, and procurement. In-house casegoods production. 500+ projects, 75,000+ guestrooms.
- **Revenue:** Undisclosed (mid-size)
- **Strengths:** True vertical integration. Domestic + offshore manufacturing. Brand-standard compliance (Marriott, Hilton, Wyndham, Best Western).
- **Weaknesses:** **Midscale-focused.** Courtyard by Marriott, not Ritz-Carlton. Interior guestroom furniture, not outdoor/pool. No luxury positioning. No operational experience.
- **Threat to HI:** Low. Wrong segment (midscale vs. luxury). Wrong environment (interior guestrooms vs. outdoor hospitality). But worth watching — if they move upmarket, they have the infrastructure.

**Hospitality Designs (North America)**
- **What:** In-house manufacturing (casegoods, pressed board, solid wood) + design. 30+ years. Domestic + Asia production.
- **Strengths:** Established manufacturing. Long track record.
- **Weaknesses:** Interior/guestroom focused. No outdoor furniture line. No beach club or resort outdoor expertise.
- **Threat to HI:** Low. Interior casegoods ≠ outdoor hospitality.

**Rebecca Windsor & Associates**
- **What:** FF&E procurement + custom manufacturing (furniture, millwork). Engineering + production.
- **Strengths:** Custom manufacturing capability. Engineering depth.
- **Weaknesses:** Procurement-first. No design vision. No outdoor specialization.
- **Threat to HI:** Low.

### Tier 4: South Florida Local Competitors

**YOLO Interiors (Davie, FL)**
- **What:** Boutique hospitality design firm. Fort Lauderdale area. Specializes in coastal/indoor-outdoor spaces.
- **Strengths:** **Geographic overlap.** Beach club and resort experience. Weather-resistant materials expertise. Local relationships.
- **Weaknesses:** No manufacturing. Design-only — they spec third-party furniture. Smaller firm, less infrastructure.
- **Threat to HI:** **Medium.** Most direct geographic and niche competitor. Could compete for the same South Florida hotel/resort projects. But HI's manufacturing (Liora) and operational credibility are differentiators YOLO can't match.

**Britto Charette (Miami/Wynwood)**
- **What:** Luxury interiors, $500K+ minimum FF&E. Turnkey custom fabrication.
- **Strengths:** High-end positioning. Miami presence. Custom fab capability.
- **Weaknesses:** Residential-leaning. No outdoor furniture manufacturing. No hospitality operations background.
- **Threat to HI:** Low-medium. Could overlap on high-end Miami hospitality, but different approach.

**SOIA Design (Fort Lauderdale/Miami)**
- **What:** Bespoke hospitality and restaurant design. Outdoor luxury integration.
- **Strengths:** Restaurant expertise. Local.
- **Weaknesses:** Design only. No manufacturing. Smaller profile.
- **Threat to HI:** Low-medium on restaurant projects.

### Tier 5: Premium Outdoor Furniture Manufacturers (Product Competitors to Liora)

These brands compete with the **Liora line** specifically — not with HI's full-service offering.

**Dedon (Germany)**
- Premium synthetic woven fiber. Sculptural, artistic. Resort-grade. **$$$$.** No design services.

**Kettal (Spain)**
- Modular outdoor systems. Aluminum + textiles. Integrated pergolas/lighting. Most "design-forward" manufacturer. **$$$$.** Limited design consultation.

**Gloster (UK)**
- Clean modern teak. Sustainable sourcing. Resort favorite. **$$$.** No design services.

**Brown Jordan (USA)**
- American classic. Aluminum + resin. Strong hospitality presence. **$$$.** No design services.

**Tuuci (Miami, FL)**
- Umbrellas, cabanas, shade structures. Marine-grade. Local to HI. **$$$.** Product only.

**Liora's advantage over all of these:** These brands sell product. Period. A hotel GM buying Dedon still needs someone to design the space, coordinate with architects, manage the procurement of 15 other vendors, and understand how the pool deck actually operates at 2pm on a Saturday. That's HI.

## HI's Competitive Advantages

### 1. The Trifecta Nobody Else Has
Design + Manufacturing + Operational Experience. We found **zero competitors** that combine all three, especially in outdoor/resort hospitality.

### 2. Operational Credibility
Peter ran Nikki Beach — 12 beach clubs, hotels, global operations — for 25 years as COO. When he designs a pool deck, he knows where the server station needs to go, how towel service flows, where guests actually sit vs. where architects think they'll sit. No design firm can claim this. It's unteachable.

### 3. The Liora Line (Vertical Integration)
Own furniture brand with manufacturing relationships in 4 countries. 42% margins on manufacturing. This isn't just a design markup — HI controls the product. Competitors spec third-party furniture and add a procurement fee. HI builds the furniture AND designs the space.

### 4. Beach Club / Outdoor Niche
Most hospitality FF&E firms are **interior guestroom focused**. The outdoor/pool/beach space is underserved by design firms. The big manufacturers (Dedon, Kettal) sell product but don't design spaces. The big design firms (HBA) do interiors. HI owns the outdoor gap.

### 5. Price-Performance
With manufacturing in Vietnam (179Decor), Indonesia (GoodWood), and Turkey (Deep), plus premium from France (Mousses Étoiles), HI can hit multiple price points while maintaining quality. A $35-45 director chair from 179Decor vs. $200+ from Dedon — same pool deck, very different margin story for the client.

---

## HI's Vulnerabilities

### 1. Scale
~$1.4M revenue, small team. Can't handle 10 simultaneous large projects. Growth requires either more people or better systems (or both).

### 2. Brand Recognition
HBA has global name recognition. HI is still building its reputation outside of the Nikki Beach network. The Liora line is young (launched 2025).

### 3. No Installation
HI ships but doesn't install. This means relying on third-party installers, which introduces quality risk and schedule dependency.

### 4. Cash Position
$167K cash (Dec 2025) with declining trend. Limited runway to absorb project delays or pursue spec work on larger opportunities.

### 5. Single-Point Dependency
Peter IS the design differentiator. His operational credibility is the moat. Scaling beyond Peter's personal capacity is the biggest long-term challenge.

---

## Opportunities

### 1. The "Operations Gap" Positioning
Market HI explicitly as **"the only FF&E firm run by someone who actually operated venues."** No one else can say this. Make it the headline, not a footnote.

### 2. Liora as the Default Outdoor Line
Position Liora not as a sub-brand but as **HI's curated outdoor furniture line** — available to any project HI designs. "We don't just pick furniture for you. We make it." This simplifies the story and strengthens the value prop.

### 3. Beach Club & Pool Deck Specialization
Own the niche. Most FF&E firms treat outdoor as secondary. HI should be the first call when a luxury hotel needs pool deck or beach club design + furniture. Target the $600M+ South Florida hospitality renovation pipeline.

### 4. Design Summit / PROFILE (March 4, 2026)
Networking with architects who specify FF&E. These are the referral sources — the architects designing the hotels that need outdoor furniture and someone who understands how the space actually works.

### 5. Partnerships with Procurement Firms
Benjamin West, Carver & Associates, etc. handle procurement for big hotel brands. HI could supply Liora product through these channels without competing on design — pure manufacturing revenue.

## Bottom Line

HI doesn't have a competitor problem. It has a **visibility problem.** The competitive position is genuinely unique — no one else combines design, manufacturing, and operational experience in luxury outdoor hospitality. The challenge is making sure the right people (hotel GMs, ownership groups, architects) know that HI exists and understand why that combination matters.

The Liora repositioning as a product line within HI (not a separate brand) tightens the story: **one company, concept through manufacturing, built by someone who ran these venues for 25 years.**
