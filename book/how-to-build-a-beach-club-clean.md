# HOW TO BUILD A BEACH CLUB

**Scaling and Building an International Brand**

This book isn't really about the literal mechanics of building a beach club. Instead, it traces the lessons learned from nearly forty years spent in the orbit of an entrepreneur who first helped build the McDonald's brand, then turned to the world of luxury beach clubs. In the beginning, the mission was simple: create a haven for college students in search of affordable sunshine and spectacle. But like any living thing, the brand evolved. The entrepreneur watched, adapted, and sometimes failed spectacularly, but always learned. What started as a playground for the masses became an exclusive destination for the global elite. Those decades were a crash course in reinvention, a masterclass in the unpredictable tides of taste and aspiration. The brand's identity was shaped not by a single stroke of genius, but by a thousand incremental changes—some planned, some accidental. By the time it became a household name, the journey had transformed everyone involved. This book is about that journey: the mistakes, the pivots, and the relentless drive to build something that endures.

## CHAPTER 1

The first time I met my teacher, I was sixteen and fresh off the plane from Canada, blinking in the heat of a Florida summer. My brother Patrick, six years older, had lured me down with promises of blue water and perpetual youth. I landed in Fort Lauderdale with a duffel bag and the kind of optimism that only comes from not yet knowing what the world can do to you. Patrick worked the valet stand outside Penrod's Beach Club, a sprawling hive of sunburned bodies and pulsing music, and he got me a job even though I didn't have a driver's license—not American, not even Canadian. I told him I'd lost it, and he shrugged and handed me a stack of parking stubs. That was enough.

Penrod's was a machine built for spring break. The owner, Jack Penrod, had figured out that college kids would spend their last dime for the chance to drink themselves into oblivion with their feet in the sand, so he made it easy for them. Five dollars bought you a plastic cup and the right to fill it all day, as many times as you wanted. There was a pasta buffet, too, but nobody remembered to eat.

Inside, the place was a maze of identities. To the right, the disco bar, where a bartender with a beard like a carpet and the kind of tan that looked expensive poured electric-colored drinks and winked at anyone who asked. To the left, a country-western saloon staffed by women in bikini tops and cutoffs, slinging beers from galvanized horse troughs. The air smelled like sunscreen, stale beer, and chlorine from the pool out back, which was ringed by a patio and a low fence that did nothing to keep the drunks from falling in.

The main entertainment, if you could call it that, was watching people try to outdo each other on the diving board. The bigger the splash, the louder the crowd screamed. Sometimes the belly-floppers came up bleeding, but nobody seemed to mind. If you wanted a different flavor, you could take the narrow stairs to the basement, where the alternative kids lurked in a cave of black lights and Cure records. It was the only place in the building where you could hear yourself think, and even then, just barely.

Between shifts, I'd watch the parade of college students, most of them from the Northeast, all of them eager to set themselves on fire for a week and then return to their real lives. They played games I'd never heard of—balcony hopping, which was exactly what it sounded like; keg stands that lasted until someone passed out or puked; impromptu wet t-shirt contests judged by whoever was loudest. Sometimes the cops came, but mostly they just watched from their cars, waiting for the next disaster.

By the second year I worked there, the city had started tearing up the road in front of the club, laying down construction cones like land mines. It was a last-ditch attempt to slow the tide of kids, to keep the spring break madness from swallowing the whole town. It didn't work, at least not right away. But even at sixteen, I could see the end coming. The party was too big, too bright—it was bound to burn out.

Still, for a while, Penrod's was the center of the universe, and I was right in the middle of it, running keys, hustling tips, watching the world get drunk and beautiful and wild before it sobered up and drove away.

---

It was in the middle of all that chaos that I met my mentor.

His name was Jack Penrod. I was sixteen years old, a valet parker at his beach club. I didn't know who he was. He just appeared to be another person looking to park his car.

He came in one early afternoon, driving a black Mercedes 300E. He entered the driveway—all the parking spots were numbered—and pulled into the first spot, labeled number one, directly beside my valet booth.

He got out and I noticed some interesting things about him. He was dressed like a businessman, but his pants were a little short. He wasn't a tall man, but he had broad shoulders and strong arms. Hair combed back smoothly. A blazer over a blue button-down with broad lapels. The pants were slightly flared. I'm not sure where he got that outfit from, but it wasn't quite American and it wasn't quite European either.

He looked at me and said, "Good morning. How are you?"

"I'm fine. How are you?"

"Do you see that number on the floor?"

"Yeah."

"What is it?"

"It says number one."

"That's right. I'm number one. I'm Jack Penrod and I own the club. This is my parking spot. So if you could be so kind as to put an orange cone here so that no other car ever parks in this spot—so that when I pull in, my spot is always ready for me. You think you could do that?"

"Yeah, sure. I'll do that."

I didn't know who he was until that moment. But I was bound to spend the next forty years of my life working for him.

---

In those early days, I got to know Jack because he came through the parking lot. He wasn't there every day, but he was always curious. He wanted to know what my life was like—what people my age were experiencing. It was as if he'd encountered something he'd never seen before, or was unaccustomed to. He was genuinely interested in understanding the mentality of young people.

Because of that, we got to know each other over the next few years and became closer. We talked about trends. We talked about what young people liked to do. We talked about music—not which bands were good or bad, but which movements were gaining traction. Was it country? Was it rock? His daughter listened to alternative music and he didn't know what it was or the culture behind it. I found the conversations invigorating.

---

It wasn't until about two years later that our relationship was strong enough for us to actually do things together. By then I was eighteen and had been working the parking lot for two years. I'd joined a band playing alternative music at a club off Sunrise Boulevard called the Reunion Room. It was a place where anyone under twenty-one could get in if they paid the doorman an extra five dollars, and you could drink as much as you liked and listen to whatever alternative bands were trending—the Smiths, Nine Inch Nails, Modern English. Music like that.

One day, Jack came into the parking lot and I mentioned I was working my other job in the evenings. He asked what it was. I told him I was in a band, playing at an alternative club.

"Well, you know," he said, "I've thought about doing an alternative club. I have a space in Penrod's, down in the basement. But I don't think I could ever get anybody to go there."

"How about we go take a look at it?"

So we walked over to the club and he led me down a set of stairs into the basement. "I didn't think I could do anything with this space," he said. "All the pipes are on the ceiling. They're exposed."

"This is perfect," I told him. "This is what alternative people like. Paint the pipes neon orange, paint the rest of the walls black, put a stage over there, and I think you could fill the place."

He looked at me skeptically. "The place you play at—the Reunion Room—how many people go there?"

"About three hundred every Thursday."

"You play there every Thursday?"

"Yeah."

"And you bring those people?"

"Yes."

"How much do they charge at the door?"

"Ten dollars."

"Do you think they'd come here?"

"If you do what we just talked about, we can play here with our band and bring those customers on an alternate night."

"What night would work?"

"The alternative crowd likes Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, for some reason I couldn't really explain."

He believed me and decided to take a crack at it. He brought his management team and engineering staff around and said, "Here's what I'd like you to do." They all had their ideas, and together they developed a club called The Underground.

The next year, every Monday night, we played and brought a good crowd to The Underground at Penrod's Beach Club. Some famous bands came through and played. It was an enjoyable experience. And to put a cherry on top of it—The Underground was where I met my wife, who happened to be my boss's daughter.

---

Jack was generous with us and paid three dollars for every person we brought into the club. It was a great run, and it continued until the Penrod's Beach Club entity came to an end.

It was a tsunami of closings—a wave of endings for most hotels and restaurants in the Fort Lauderdale Beach area during the late eighties. The reason was simple: the city fathers had decided that the spring break era must end. Too many incidents. The mayhem had become all-encompassing. The antics were in the newspapers. Kids were coming to Fort Lauderdale and getting hurt. Too much debauchery.

So the city tore up the road. The aftermath was a collapse in tourism, an inability to drive up and down the beachfront. Businesses started closing, one after another. A new directive was written for the future of Fort Lauderdale: towers and hotels. Five-star services for a new, elite, wealthy consumer. It took the next decade to build that version of Fort Lauderdale—one designed for an older, more mature clientele.

---

Over the course of the next thirty-eight years, I would follow in Jack's footsteps—in his shadow—as we traversed a myriad of landscapes developing beach clubs locally and in far-flung lands, where operational control was held together by phone calls and emails and frequent trips. We broke down language barriers, navigated customs and financial obstacles, taxation and compliance. We dealt with personalities and ego, with people who were righteous and selfish and sometimes criminal.

The terrain was expansive, and we were a small family from Florida. Not bilingual. Armed with operational experience from McDonald's. It was an experience that was breathtaking and sometimes absolutely horrendous.

## CHAPTER 2: The View from the Street

During my tenure as Director of Global Operations, we had the opportunity to open many different properties. Some were successful. Some were not. And to be honest, my part was fairly limited in many of them—most certainly in the selection process during the earlier years. The drive for scalability was handled by other parties in the company. But to be a bystander, to have minimal influence while having the opportunity to watch and receive feedback from people on the ground—that was enormous. It was an education you couldn't buy. You pack away these little tidbits of information, and they stay with you, and they matter when it comes time to pick your next location.

Jack had a particular style when it came to assessments.

In one instance, I had just finished redesigning a club. I was proud of the work and eager for the review that would generally follow. The process was always the same: Jack would fly into the country, come to the property, and walk every inch of the operation, checking the modifications and reviewing the details.

This time, I was waiting anxiously at the entrance for his arrival. I expected we would walk in together and start looking at everything I'd done. But when his car pulled up and he stepped out, he didn't walk toward the club. He started walking the other way—out of the driveway, across the street.

I followed him, confused. We crossed the road and walked about a hundred yards up the block in silence. Finally, I asked, "What are we doing?"

He turned around. Almost as if enough time had lapsed, enough footsteps taken, the distance from the club just right for the lesson to land. He looked at me and said, "When you build a club, you don't start an assessment from inside the club. You start from the perspective of the customer—and what the customer sees from the street."

Then he turned back toward the property. "Okay. How visible is the signage? How big is the signage? Which direction is the signage pointing?"

I was flabbergasted. I had never taken this perspective on club development. Not once. And in hindsight, I thought about some of our other properties—particularly in France—that were nearly impossible to find. A tiny sign on a tree with an arrow. Almost like something out of a Leonardo DiCaprio movie, this hidden jewel that you had to know about to discover. And in those cases, the obscurity was part of the appeal. That was the brand.

But the lesson was bigger than signage. It was about understanding what makes a brand special, and how every decision—from the street view to the secret entrance—either reinforces or erodes it.

By the time Jack and I had finished building out a proper program for evaluating new locations, it included far more than geography. We assessed the direction of the wind. At what time of day the sun would drop behind buildings and cast shade across the property—and how that would affect revenue. The quality of the sand. The clarity of the ocean. Who the tourists were, and just as importantly, who the locals were. Their customs, their habits, their expectations.

After years of doing this—assessing location after location across continents—I reached a point where I could look at a new territory and tell you within a hundred thousand dollars how that property would perform in its first year. And because of that, there were many properties we simply had to say no to. The customer demographic wasn't right. The economics weren't sustainable. The brand didn't belong there.

Which brings me to a harder lesson: what happens when you ignore all of that.

---

I can give you an example. We decided to open a beach club on a particular Caribbean island. The spot was up and coming—at least we thought so—and we went in based on the encouragement of our financial partners to establish a position in the market.

We pursued it vigorously. Built a beautiful club on the coast. Magnificent water. A fantastic manager—one of our best. A world-class menu. In the early months, customers would fly in from the city by helicopter. Richard Branson came. Others like him followed.

But the property was not close to any populated area. It was out of the way, and from a geographical standpoint, it was a risky acquisition on every front. Sometimes getting ahead of a market can work—if tourism is growing, if development is coming, if there's a local base that can sustain you while the area catches up to your vision. But if that growth doesn't happen in tandem with your investment, you're exposed.

As the months went on and summer arrived, revenue dropped significantly. Our manager did what any good manager would do—he organized events, tried to attract the local market. But then we discovered the problem.

Less than half a mile away, there was a local who had been operating his own place for thirty-five years. Every morning, he'd cast a lobster trap, haul in the day's catch, and sell lobster for four dollars a pound. The locals clamored for it. A great meal at a great price, from a man they'd known their whole lives.

Our establishment—an upscale operation charging twenty times that for a lobster dish—simply could not compete. Not on price. Not on loyalty. Not on authenticity.

The effects were devastating. After months of suppression by a market that was never going to adopt us, the club closed.

The lesson was more than evident. We had damaged a relationship with an investor who was overly confident in their own marketplace. We had spent enormous time and energy developing a market that was never going to contribute to our global return. And worst of all, we had burned the energy of good people—talented operators—on a venture they ultimately had to walk away from.

The problem wasn't the manager. It wasn't the menu or the music or the service. The problem was a decision made much earlier in the process: to build in a location that was not fitting for the brand.

That is the signal. That is the warning sign. When an operation starts chasing revenue by changing its identity—bringing in knockoff UB40 cover bands to appease a market you shouldn't have entered in the first place—you've already lost. The misalignment didn't happen on the ground. It happened at the top, long before anyone poured the first drink.
