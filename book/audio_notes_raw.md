## Audio 1: The $4 Lobster (Brand Alignment & Market Fit)

But what you don't want to have happening is having an operation that is chasing revenue and then simply decides to change the brand identity and the things that the brand represents merely to change the revenue. That is a signal and a warning sign that you've fallen off track.

But it may not be a manager's fault for trying to meet the objectives of the company from a revenue perspective. That's all well and good. But the problem lies in a decision that was made much, much earlier in the process, which was to develop a property in a location that was not fitting for the brand.

For example, you have a property that plays commercial DJ music but it's not adopted by the local community or the tourist community and then you wind up having bands that are knockoffs of UB40 to appease a market that you shouldn't have been in in the first place. It's a scenario where there is no alignment from the top down.

Unfortunately, sometimes you believe that you've got all of your ducks in a row and you come to find out at a much later stage that you didn't.

I can give you an example in one particular Caribbean island. We decided that we were going to open up a beach club and so we selected a spot that was up and coming — at least we thought so anyways — and we went in based on the encouragement of our financial partners to establish a position in the market there.

So we pursued it vigorously and built a club to operate there. The club came out beautiful, it was magnificent on the coast, beautiful waters. However, it was not necessarily close to a particular populated area. It was most certainly out of the way and looking at it purely from a geographical positioning, it was a risky acquisition on all fronts.

But sometimes getting in front of a market can be a good thing if you have a strong sense that the market is going to increase, that the tourism is going to increase, that there is development in the marketplace, that there's a strong local base that we're able to feed the product while you are developing your product alongside with a community that's expanding.

It's all well and good, however, if that doesn't happen in tandem with the development of your brand, well then you're at great risk.

In this particular scenario, we had a beautiful club that we'd built, a fantastic manager — one of our best managers — and a magnificent menu. And in the initial months after opening, customers would fly to our location, they would take helicopters and fly in from the city. And big names would come like Richard Branson and others alike.

However, as the months went on and summertime kicked in, the operation started to see a reduction in revenue significantly. And the manager did what he could to increase revenue by doing events that attracted the local market into the venue, as any manager would do.

However, economics became a factor when we discovered that our nearest competitor — who was a local who had been living and operating his club for 35 years, less than a half mile away — was attracting the locals.

And so our manager went over to see why the locals were enjoying this club and not attending his. And he came to find out very quickly. And that was that the owner of the club would cast a lobster trap in the morning every day and bring his catch in fresh and sell lobster for $4 a pound. The locals would clamor for it and it was a great meal provided by a local at a great price.

And our establishment being an upscale establishment which charged 20 times that amount for a lobster dish simply could not compete at all.

And the effects of this were paramount and inevitably after a certain time of suppression by the market, the club inevitably closed.

And the lesson was more than evident. Not only had we damaged a relationship with an investor who was overly confident in their own marketplace, we had spent an enormous amount of time with our eyes focused on developing a market that really at the end of the day was not going to contribute to our global ROI. And we had burned the energy of good human resource on a product that they had to walk away from.

## Audio 2: The Street Assessment & Site Selection

There's been in my tenure as Director of Global Operations — we had the opportunity to open up many different properties. Some of them successful, some of them not so successful, and to be honest, my part was fairly limited in many of them, most certainly in the selection process in the earlier years.

The drive for scalability was handled by other parties in our company, but to be a bystander and to have a minimal influence while having the opportunity to watch and receive the feedback from people on the ground was enormous. It was an educational process — you pack away these little tidbits of information that really help you when it comes to picking new locations.

My mentor had a particular style about him. In one particular scenario, I had finished redesigning a club, and I was excited for the assessment process that would generally happen. He would fly into the country and then come to the property and assess essentially the modifications and review all the particular points of the operation.

In this one particular instance, I was anxiously waiting at the door for his arrival. I expected that we would go in and start looking at the operation, and when he pulled up in the car, he got out of the car and I greeted him and he started walking out of the driveway towards the other side of the street.

I curiously followed him thinking that we would go into the club and start to assess the modifications and the revamped property. By the time I caught up to him, we got to the other side of the street. He looked at me sternly and I knew this was going to be a teaching moment. To what degree I had no idea, but I could tell from the look on his face that he was prepared to teach me something.

I followed him onto the street and he was quiet and we crossed the street and we walked up the street about a hundred yards and finally, after a few moments of quiet walking, I said, "What are we doing?"

And he turned around — almost like enough time had lapsed, enough footsteps had been taken, the distance from the club was quite far enough for him to start to answer the question — and he looked at me and he says, "When you build a club, you don't start an assessment from inside the club. You start from the perspective of the customer and what the customer sees from the street."

And he turned around and looked back at the club and he said, "Okay. How visible is the signage? How big is the signage? Which direction is the signage pointing?"

I was honestly quite flabbergasted because I hadn't ever taken this perspective of club development. As a matter of fact, in hindsight, I think back about some of our other clubs that we designed and developed and some of them — particularly in France — were very, very difficult to find, with small signage, literally a tiny sign on a tree that pointed with an arrow. And it almost made it something out of a Leonardo DiCaprio movie where it's this hidden little jewel that you have to know where it is, that made it appealing.

And this really points to the brand and brand development and what makes a brand special.

Jack was quite the entrepreneur. By the time that we were done developing a program for new business development, it included a lot of assessments — not only the location, but the direction of the wind. At what time of day does the sun become hidden from view and shade across the property and how that would affect revenue for the property? What was the quality of the sand? What was the quality of the ocean? Furthermore, what was the clientele? Not only the tourists, but also the local clientele and what were their customs and traits?

All of these things and more had an impact on consideration for the development of a brand. At one particular point, after assessing many, many locations, I could look at a territory and tell you within $100,000 how well that property would perform during that year.

And because of that, there were many properties that we simply just had to say no to developing our brand there. Was it the right customer demographic? Was it sustainable?

Which really brings me to a discussion about sustaining your brand without changing your brand. And I'm not talking about changing your programming from one year to the next, because there are certain parts of your programming that should always be continuously evolving.
