### Raw Text (Peter's words)

Jack was generous with us and paid us $3 per person we brought into the club and the club was a great experience and it continued for a period of time until the Penrod's Beach Club entity came to an end.

It was a tsunami of businesses closing — a tsunami of endings for most hotels and restaurateurs in the Fort Lauderdale Beach area during those late 80s. And the reason was simple: the city fathers had decided that the spring break era must come to an end in Fort Lauderdale. Too many incidents were occurring. The mayhem had become overarching. The antics were in the newspaper. Kids were coming to Fort Lauderdale and hurting themselves. Too much debauchery.

And so the city decided to tear up the road. And the aftermath was a lack of tourism, inability to drive up and down the road. And as a result, businesses started closing and crashing.

A new directive was written for the future of Fort Lauderdale which included towers and hotels — towers and hotels for five-star services for a new elite, wealthy consumer — which took the next decade to develop a version of Fort Lauderdale for an older, more mature clientele.

### Notes
- $3 per head brought into The Underground — Peter's first taste of performance-based compensation in hospitality
- "Tsunami of endings" — strong language, matches the scale of what happened
- The city literally destroyed the infrastructure to kill spring break — tore up the road
- This is a pivotal macro-level shift: Fort Lauderdale transforms from spring break party town to luxury destination
- The irony: the same transformation that killed Penrod's eventually created the market for Nikki Beach and luxury beach clubs
- Jack would have watched his business die AND seen the future being built at the same time
- Key book theme: markets don't just shift — sometimes they're deliberately destroyed and rebuilt. Understanding that cycle is critical for anyone building in hospitality.
- Connects to Chapter 1 (California City / "If You Build It") — sometimes the market is taken away from you, not just absent
