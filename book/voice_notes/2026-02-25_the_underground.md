### Raw Text (Peter's words)

It wasn't until about two years later that our relationship was strong enough that we actually started to do things together. By that time, I was 18 years old and I had now been working in the parking lot for two years. And I had joined a band playing alternative music in one of the clubs off of Sunrise Boulevard called the Reunion Room. It was a place where basically anybody under 21 years old could go if they paid the doorman an extra $5 and you could drink as much as you like and listen to alternative bands that were trending at the time like the Smiths and Nine Inch Nails and Modern English and music like that.

And it was one day where Jack came into the parking lot and I had told him that I was working at my other job in the evening and he inquired what it was and I told him I was in a band and I was playing in an alternative club. And he says, "Well, you know, I thought about doing an alternative club and I have a space in Penrod's in the basement, but I don't think I could ever get anybody to go there." And I said, "Well, how about we go take a look at it?"

So together, we trucked on over to the club and he walked me down a set of stairs into the basement and we started there and he says, "You know, I didn't think I could do anything with this space because, you know, all the pipes are on the ceiling and they're exposed." And I retorted to him. I said, "This is perfect. This is what alternative people like. Paint them neon orange and paint the rest of the walls black and put a stage over there and I think you could fill the place."

He looked at me skeptically and he says, "Well, the place that you play at, the Reunion Room, how many people go there?" And I responded, "I think we get about 300 people there every Thursday." He says, "So you play there every Thursday?" I said, "Yeah." And he says, "Well, and you bring those people." And I said, "Yes." And he says, "Well, how much they charge at the door?" I said, "10 dollars." He said, "Well, do you think they would come here?" I said, "Well, if you do what we just talked about, we can play here with our band and we can bring those customers here on an alternate night." And he says, "Well, what night would work?" I said, "Well, again, you know, the alternative people like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesdays for some strange reason which I couldn't really explain."

But he believed me and decided that he was going to take a crack at it. So he brought his team of management around and engineering staff and said, "Here's what I'd like you to do." And they all had their ideas and contributed to developing a club called The Underground.

Next year, every Monday night, we would play and bring a good crowd of people to The Underground at the Penrod's Beach Club. Some famous bands came through there and played and it was an enjoyable experience and to just put a carrot on top of it — the place where I met my wife, which ironically happened to be my boss's daughter.

### Notes
- This is the first COLLABORATION between Peter and Jack — the moment Peter goes from employee to creative partner
- The Underground = Peter's first "build" — he essentially designed the concept, identified the market, and brought the audience
- Jack's genius: he LISTENED to an 18-year-old. "Paint the pipes neon orange, paint the walls black, put a stage there." And he did it.
- The business logic dialogue is incredible — Jack breaks it down like a deal: How many people? What do they charge? Would they come here? What night? Pure operator.
- "Alternative people like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesdays for some strange reason" — funny, authentic
- Tracy reveal at the end: "my boss's daughter" — the love story begins in the basement of the beach club. You can't write this.
- Connects back to the earlier Penrod's description mentioning "the basement, where the alternative kids lurked in a cave of black lights and Cure records" — now we know the origin of that space
- Key book theme: Jack trusted young people's instincts about culture. That's how he stayed ahead.
