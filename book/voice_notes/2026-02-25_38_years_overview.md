### Raw Text (Peter's words)

Over the course of the next 38 years I would follow in Jack's footsteps, in his shadow, as we traversed across a myriad of landscapes developing beach clubs locally and in far away distant lands where operational control was tied together by phone calls and emails along with frequent, normal trips — breaking down language barriers, service, customs, financial barriers, taxation, tax compliance, personalities, ego, shadows, righteous, selfish, and criminal.

The terrain was expansive and we were a small family from Florida. Not bilingual. With operational experiences from McDonald's. It was an experience breathtaking and sometimes absolutely horrendous.

### Notes
- This reads like a book overview/transition paragraph — bridges the origin story to the global expansion chapters
- The list is raw and real: "language barriers, service, customs, financial barriers, taxation, tax compliance, personalities, ego, shadows, righteous, selfish, and criminal" — each one of those could be a chapter or a story
- "Criminal" — that word sits at the end of the list like a grenade. Readers will want to know.
- "A small family from Florida. Not bilingual. With operational experiences from McDonald's." — Three sentences that capture the absurdity and audacity of what they attempted
- "Breathtaking and sometimes absolutely horrendous" — the duality that makes this book honest
- This is the promise to the reader: you're going to get ALL of it
