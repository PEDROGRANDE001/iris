### Raw Text (Peter's words)

Picking up from the line, "sobered up and drove away."

It was in the middle of all that chaos that I was to meet my mentor. His name was Jack Penrod. I was 16 years old, a valet parker at his beach club, Penrod's on the Beach. I didn't know it at the time. But he just appeared to be another person looking to park his car. And it just so happened that he came in in the early afternoon, driving a black Mercedes 300E model. And he entered the driveway. And all of the parking spots were numbered. And he pulled into the first parking spot, which was labeled number one, directly beside my valet booth.

And he got out of his car. And for some reason, I noticed some very interesting things about him. He was dressed like a businessman. But for some reason, his pants were a little short. He wasn't a tall man, but he had broad shoulders and strong arms. His hair combed back smoothly. And a blazer on with a blue button-down with broad lapels on it. The pants were also flared a little bit. I'm not sure where he got that outfit from, but it wasn't quite American and it wasn't quite European either.

He looked at me and he said, "Good morning. How are you?" And I said, "I'm fine. How are you?" And he says, "Do you see that number on the floor?" And I said, "Yeah." And he says, "What is it?" And I said, "It says number one." And he says, "That's right. I'm number one. I'm Jack Penrod and I own the club. And this is my parking spot. So if you could be so kind as to put an orange cone here so that no other car ever parks in this spot, so that when I pull in here, my spot is always ready for me. If you think you could do that for me." And I said, "Yeah, sure. I'll do that."

I didn't know who he was until that moment. But I was bound to spend the next 40 years of my life working for him.

And I found it curious that in those early days, I got to know him because he came in the parking lot. He was not quite frequent, and he was always curious. He wanted to know what my life was like and what the life of people my age and around me were experiencing. Like something that he had never experienced before or knew about or was unaccustomed with. It was an odd thing. But he was very interested in understanding the mentality of people my age.

Because of that, we got to know each other over the next few years and became closer friends. We talked about trends and we talked about what young people like to do. We talked about music — not necessarily which bands were good and bad, but basically which trends were more popular. Was it country? Was it rock? I didn't know about alternative music because his daughter listened to alternative music and he didn't know what it was or the trend behind it. Which I found the conversations invigorating.

### Notes
- Direct continuation from the Penrod's Beach Club opening scene
- The "number one" parking spot exchange is GOLD — reveals Jack's character instantly (confident, direct, a showman, but also polite)
- Jack's outfit description: "not quite American, not quite European" — perfect detail, hints at his global sensibility
- Black Mercedes 300E — specific, cinematic
- Key insight: Jack studied youth culture through Peter. He wasn't just running a club — he was doing market research through genuine human curiosity
- His daughter (Tracy, Peter's future wife) listened to alternative music — natural foreshadowing
- "I was bound to spend the next 40 years of my life working for him" — powerful line, said matter-of-factly
- The parking lot as the place where the relationship formed — not an office, not a meeting room. A parking lot. That says everything about both of them.
