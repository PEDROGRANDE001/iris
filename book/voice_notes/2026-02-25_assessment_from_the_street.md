### Raw Text (Peter's words)

There's been in my tenure as Director of Global Operations, we had the opportunity to open up many different properties. Some of them successful, some of them not so successful. And to be honest, my part was fairly limited in many of them, particularly in the selection process in the earlier years. The drive for scalability was handled by other parties in our company. But to be a bystander and to have a minimal influence while having the opportunity to watch and receive the feedback from people on the ground — it was an educational process. You pack away these little tidbits of information that really help you when it comes to picking new locations.

My mentor had a particular style about him. In one particular scenario, I had finished redesigning a club and I was excited for the assessment process that would generally happen. He would fly into the country and then come to the property and assess essentially the modifications and review all the particular points of the operation.

On this one particular instance, I was anxiously waiting at the door for his arrival. And I expected that we would go in and start looking at the operation. And when he pulled up in the car, he got out of the car and I greeted him and he started walking out of the driveway towards the other side of the street. I curiously followed him thinking that we would go into the club and start to assess the modifications and the revamped property.

And by the time I caught up to him, we got to the other side of the street. He looked at me sternly. And I knew this was going to be a teaching moment. To what degree I had no idea, but I could tell from the look on his face that he was prepared to teach me something.

I followed him onto the street and he was quiet and we crossed the street and we walked up the street about 100 yards. And finally, after a few moments of quiet walking, I said, "What are we doing?" And he turned around almost like enough time had lapsed. Enough footsteps had been taken. The distance from the club was quite fair enough for him to start to answer the question.

And he looked at me and he says, "When you build a club, you don't start an assessment from inside the club. You start from the perspective of the customer and what the customer sees from the street." And he turned around and looked back at the club and he said, "Okay, how visible is the signage? How big is the signage? Which direction is the signage pointing?"

I was honestly quite flabbergasted because I hadn't ever taken this perspective of club development. As a matter of fact, in hindsight, I think back about some of our other clubs that we designed and developed. And some of them, particularly in France, were very, very difficult to find with small signage — literally a tiny sign on a tree that pointed with an arrow. And it almost made it like something out of a Leonardo DiCaprio movie where it's this hidden little jewel that you have to know where it is that made it appealing.

And this really points to the brand and brand development and what makes a brand special.

Jack was quite the entrepreneur. By the time that we were done developing a program for new business development, it included a lot of assessments — not only the location but the direction of the wind. At what time of day does the sun become hidden from view and shade across the property and how that would affect revenue for the property? What was the quality of the sand? What was the quality of the ocean? Furthermore, what was the clientele? Not only the tourists, but also the local clientele. And what were their customs and traits?

All of these things and more had an impact on consideration for the development of a brand. At one particular point, after assessing many, many locations, I could look at a territory and tell you within $100,000 how well that property would perform during that year.

And because of that, there were many properties that we simply just had to say no to developing our brand there. Was it the right customer demographic? Was it sustainable?

Which really brings me to a discussion about sustaining your brand without changing your brand. And I'm not talking about changing your programming from one year to the next, because there are certain parts of your programming that should always be continuously evolving.

### Notes
- INCREDIBLE teaching scene: Jack walks AWAY from the club, crosses the street, walks 100 yards — silent — then turns and teaches
- "You don't start an assessment from inside the club. You start from the perspective of the customer." — This is a CHAPTER TITLE or pull quote
- The silence and the walk = Jack's teaching method. He made Peter feel the distance before explaining it. Theatrical, deliberate.
- The France signage contrast is brilliant — sometimes invisibility IS the brand. A tiny sign on a tree. "Like a Leonardo DiCaprio movie" (The Beach reference?)
- Jack's full assessment checklist became a science:
  - Signage visibility and direction
  - Wind direction
  - Sun position / shade timing and its impact on REVENUE
  - Sand quality
  - Ocean quality
  - Tourist vs local clientele demographics
  - Customs and traits of locals
- "I could look at a territory and tell you within $100,000 how well that property would perform" — extraordinary claim, earned through decades of pattern recognition
- Transition at the end: sustaining brand vs changing brand, programming evolution — sets up the next thought
- This belongs in the Location chapter OR a standalone chapter on Assessment / Due Diligence
