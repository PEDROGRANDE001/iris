### Raw Text (Peter's words)

But what you don't want to have happening is having an operation that is chasing revenue and then simply decides to change the brand identity and the things that the brand represents merely to change the revenue. That is a signal and a warning sign that you've fallen off track. But it may not be a manager's fault for trying to meet the objectives of the company from a revenue perspective. That's all well and good. But the problem lies in a decision that was made much, much earlier in the process, which was to develop a product property in a location that was not fitting for the brand.

For example, you have a property that plays commercial DJ music, but it's not adopted by the local community or the tourist community. And then you wind up having bands that are offs of UB40 to appease a market that you shouldn't have been in in the first place. It's a scenario where there is no alignment from the top down.

Unfortunately, sometimes you believe that you've got all of your ducks in a row. And you come to find out at a much later stage that you didn't.

I can give you an example in one particular Caribbean island. We decided that we were going to open up a beach club. And so we selected a spot that was up and coming. At least we thought so anyways. And we went in based on the encouragement of our financial partners to establish a position in the market there. And so we pursued it vigorously and built a club to operate there.

The club came out beautiful. It was magnificent on the coast, beautiful waters. However, it was not necessarily close to a particular populated area. It was low, certainly out of the way. And looking at it purely from a geographical positioning, it was a risky acquisition on all fronts.

But sometimes getting in front of a market can be a good thing if you have a strong sense that the market is going to increase, that the tourism is going to increase, that there is development in the marketplace, that there's a strong local base that's able to feed the product while you are developing your product alongside a community that's expanding. That's all well and good. However, if that doesn't happen in tandem with the development of your brand, well then you're at great risk.

In this particular scenario, we had a beautiful club that we'd built, a fantastic manager — one of our best managers — and a magnificent menu. And in the initial months after opening, customers would fly to our location. They would take helicopters and fly in from the city. And big names would come like Richard Branson and others alike.

However, as the months went on and summertime kicked in, the operation started to see a reduction in revenue significantly. And the manager did what he could to increase revenue by doing events that attracted the local market into the venue, as any manager would do.

However, economics became a factor when we discovered that our nearest competitor, who was a local, who had been living and operating his club for 35 years less than a half mile away, was attracting the locals. And so our manager went over to see why the locals were enjoying this club and not attending his.

And he came to find out very quickly. And that was that the owner of the club would cast a lobster trap in the morning every day and bring his catch in fresh and sell lobster for $4 a pound. The locals would clamor for it. And it was a great meal provided by a local at a great price.

And our establishment being an upscale establishment, which charged 20 times that amount for a lobster dish, simply could not compete at all. And the effects of this were paramount.

And inevitably, after a certain time of suppression by the market, the club inevitably closed. And the lesson was more than evident. Not only had we damaged a relationship with an investor who was overly confident in their own marketplace, we had spent an enormous amount of time with our eyes focused on developing a market that really, at the end of the day, was not going to contribute to our global ROI. And we had burned the energy of good human resource on a product that they had to walk away from.

### Notes
- THE $4 LOBSTER STORY — this is the kind of anecdote that makes a book unforgettable
- The lesson is layered:
  1. Don't chase revenue by changing brand identity — that's a symptom, not a solution
  2. The real mistake was made at location selection, not at the operational level
  3. You can't out-luxury a local who's been there 35 years selling $4 lobster
  4. Financial partners can encourage bad decisions based on their own market confidence
  5. The human cost: burning a great manager on a doomed location
- Three types of damage from a bad location: investor relationship, time/focus diverted from global ROI, human resource burned out
- Richard Branson helicoptering in — the initial glamour masking the underlying market failure
- UB40 cover bands = the sound of a brand dying. Brilliant detail.
- "Getting in front of a market" framework: works IF tourism is growing, development is happening, local base can sustain you during growth. Fails if those don't materialize.
- This is a PERFECT companion to the California City / "If You Build It" chapter
