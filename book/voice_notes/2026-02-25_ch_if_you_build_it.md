### Raw Notes

**Chapter concept:** "If You Build It, They Will Come — Not Really"

- About developing/designing restaurants, beach clubs, entertainment venues, and social spots in unique/uncharted parts of the world
- Personal experiences developing restaurants in uncharted territories
- Mentor (Jack Penrod) created beach clubs/restaurants in many cases in up-and-coming markets
- Great successes — huge clubs that became internationally recognized
- But equally, more than a handful of locations that were NOT financially successful and were closed down
- **Core lesson: Location, location, location** — can't say enough about the importance
- Learned valuable lessons from mentor's 30 years of experience, as long as he was willing to listen

**The California City Story (chapter hook/analogy):**
- Recent trip to Mojave Desert with son Austin — motorcycle ride
- Started from northwest outskirts of California City
- Drove to Mojave, stayed overnight, breakfast at the Voyager Restaurant
- Voyager sits on the runway of Mojave Airport — view of runway + fleet of decommissioned jets with fading airline logos
- Some brands recognizable, some never heard of
- California City was a planned community by **Nat Mendelsohn** in the 1950s
- Mendelsohn envisioned it as a thriving urban center — strategic location near highways, proximity to LA
- Project collapsed: ambitious plans not matched by demand, couldn't attract residents/businesses, lack of infrastructure/amenities, economic downturns, speculative real estate
- "Build it and they will come" proved misleading — development was built, people never came
- **Cautionary tale:** infrastructure alone can't drive growth without community interest and economic viability

### Writing Notes
- Powerful parallel between California City and failed beach club locations
- The Mojave/motorcycle trip with Austin is a great narrative device — father/son, open road, discovering a ghost of ambition
- Decommissioned jets with fading logos = metaphor for brands that didn't survive
- This chapter bridges personal mentor lessons with a universal business truth
