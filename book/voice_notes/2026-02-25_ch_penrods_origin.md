### Raw Text (Peter's words)

The first time I met my teacher, I was sixteen and fresh off the plane from Canada, blinking in the heat of a Florida summer. My brother Patrick, six years older, had lured me down with promises of blue water and perpetual youth. I landed in Fort Lauderdale with a duffel bag and the kind of optimism that only comes from not yet knowing what the world can do to you. Patrick worked the valet stand outside Penrod's Beach Club, a sprawling hive of sunburned bodies and pulsing music, and he got me a job even though I didn't have a driver's license—not American, not even Canadian. I told him I'd lost it, and he shrugged and handed me a stack of parking stubs. That was enough.

Penrod's was a machine built for spring break. The owner, Jack Penrod, had figured out that college kids would spend their last dime for the chance to drink themselves into oblivion with their feet in the sand, so he made it easy for them. Five dollars bought you a plastic cup and the right to fill it all day, as many times as you wanted. There was a pasta buffet, too, but nobody remembered to eat.

Inside, the place was a maze of identities. To the right, the disco bar, where a bartender with a beard like a carpet and the kind of tan that looked expensive poured electric-colored drinks and winked at anyone who asked. To the left, a country-western saloon staffed by women in bikini tops and cutoffs, slinging beers from galvanized horse troughs. The air smelled like sunscreen, stale beer, and chlorine from the pool out back, which was ringed by a patio and a low fence that did nothing to keep the drunks from falling in.

The main entertainment, if you could call it that, was watching people try to outdo each other on the diving board. The bigger the splash, the louder the crowd screamed. Sometimes the belly-floppers came up bleeding, but nobody seemed to mind. If you wanted a different flavor, you could take the narrow stairs to the basement, where the alternative kids lurked in a cave of black lights and Cure records. It was the only place in the building where you could hear yourself think, and even then, just barely.

Between shifts, I'd watch the parade of college students, most of them from the Northeast, all of them eager to set themselves on fire for a week and then return to their real lives. They played games I'd never heard of—balcony hopping, which was exactly what it sounded like; keg stands that lasted until someone passed out or puked; impromptu wet t-shirt contests judged by whoever was loudest. Sometimes the cops came, but mostly they just watched from their cars, waiting for the next disaster.

By the second year I worked there, the city had started tearing up the road in front of the club, laying down construction cones like land mines. It was a last-ditch attempt to slow the tide of kids, to keep the spring break madness from swallowing the whole town. It didn't work, at least not right away. But even at sixteen, I could see the end coming. The party was too big, too bright—it was bound to burn out.

Still, for a while, Penrod's was the center of the universe, and I was right in the middle of it, running keys, hustling tips, watching the world get drunk and beautiful and wild before it sobered up and drove away.

### Notes
- This is origin story material — Chapter 2 candidate or possibly the book's opening
- Writing quality is already very high — this reads like a published memoir
- Vivid sensory detail: sunscreen/stale beer/chlorine, black lights, galvanized horse troughs
- Strong voice — wry, observational, nostalgic without being sentimental
- Key characters introduced: Patrick (brother), Jack Penrod (mentor/teacher)
- Fort Lauderdale spring break era as the primordial soup of the beach club concept
