### Raw Text (Peter's words)

This book isn't really about the literal mechanics of building a beach club. Instead, it traces the lessons learned from nearly forty years spent in the orbit of an entrepreneur who first helped build the McDonald's brand, then turned to the world of luxury beach clubs. In the beginning, the mission was simple: create a haven for college students in search of affordable sunshine and spectacle. But like any living thing, the brand evolved. The entrepreneur watched, adapted, and sometimes failed spectacularly, but always learned. What started as a playground for the masses became an exclusive destination for the global elite. Those decades were a crash course in reinvention, a masterclass in the unpredictable tides of taste and aspiration. The brand's identity was shaped not by a single stroke of genius, but by a thousand incremental changes—some planned, some accidental. By the time it became a household name, the journey had transformed everyone involved. This book is about that journey: the mistakes, the pivots, and the relentless drive to build something that endures.

### Notes
- This is the book's thesis statement — could be the jacket copy or the introduction's closing paragraph
- Key reveal: Jack Penrod helped build the McDonald's brand before beach clubs
- The arc: spring break for college kids → exclusive global elite destination
- "Not a single stroke of genius, but a thousand incremental changes" — that's the core insight
- This reframes the entire book: it's NOT a how-to manual. It's a study in reinvention through the lens of one brand's evolution.
