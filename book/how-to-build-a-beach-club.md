HOW TO BUILD A BEACH CLUB
Scaling and Building an International Brand

This book isn't really about the literal mechanics of building a beach club. Instead, it traces the lessons learned from nearly forty years spent in the orbit of an entrepreneur who first helped build the McDonald's brand, then turned to the world of luxury beach clubs. In the beginning, the mission was simple: create a haven for college students in search of affordable sunshine and spectacle. But like any living thing, the brand evolved. The entrepreneur watched, adapted, and sometimes failed spectacularly, but always learned. What started as a playground for the masses became an exclusive destination for the global elite. Those decades were a crash course in reinvention, a masterclass in the unpredictable tides of taste and aspiration. The brand's identity was shaped not by a single stroke of genius, but by a thousand incremental changes—some planned, some accidental. By the time it became a household name, the journey had transformed everyone involved. This book is about that journey: the mistakes, the pivots, and the relentless drive to build something that endures.

CHAPTER 1
The first time I met my teacher, I was sixteen and fresh off the plane from Canada, blinking in the heat of a Florida summer. My brother Patrick, six years older, had lured me down with promises of blue water and perpetual youth. I landed in Fort Lauderdale with a duffel bag and the kind of optimism that only comes from not yet knowing what the world can do to you. Patrick worked the valet stand outside Penrod's Beach Club, a sprawling hive of sunburned bodies and pulsing music, and he got me a job even though I didn't have a driver's license—not American, not even Canadian. I told him I'd lost it, and he shrugged and handed me a stack of parking stubs. That was enough.
Penrod's was a machine built for spring break. The owner, Jack Penrod, had figured out that college kids would spend their last dime for the chance to drink themselves into oblivion with their feet in the sand, so he made it easy for them. Five dollars bought you a plastic cup and the right to fill it all day, as many times as you wanted. There was a pasta buffet, too, but nobody remembered to eat.
Inside, the place was a maze of identities. To the right, the disco bar, where a bartender with a beard like a carpet and the kind of tan that looked expensive poured electric-colored drinks and winked at anyone who asked. To the left, a country-western saloon staffed by women in bikini tops and cutoffs, slinging beers from galvanized horse troughs. The air smelled like sunscreen, stale beer, and chlorine from the pool out back, which was ringed by a patio and a low fence that did nothing to keep the drunks from falling in.
The main entertainment, if you could call it that, was watching people try to outdo each other on the diving board. The bigger the splash, the louder the crowd screamed. Sometimes the belly-floppers came up bleeding, but nobody seemed to mind. If you wanted a different flavor, you could take the narrow stairs to the basement, where the alternative kids lurked in a cave of black lights and Cure records. It was the only place in the building where you could hear yourself think, and even then, just barely.
Between shifts, I'd watch the parade of college students, most of them from the Northeast, all of them eager to set themselves on fire for a week and then return to their real lives. They played games I'd never heard of—balcony hopping, which was exactly what it sounded like; keg stands that lasted until someone passed out or puked; impromptu wet t-shirt contests judged by whoever was loudest. Sometimes the cops came, but mostly they just watched from their cars, waiting for the next disaster.
By the second year I worked there, the city had started tearing up the road in front of the club, laying down construction cones like land mines. It was a last-ditch attempt to slow the tide of kids, to keep the spring break madness from swallowing the whole town. It didn't work, at least not right away. But even at sixteen, I could see the end coming. The party was too big, too bright—it was bound to burn out.
Still, for a while, Penrod's was the center of the universe, and I was right in the middle of it, running keys, hustling tips, watching the world get drunk and beautiful and wild before it sobered up and drove away.
________________
It was in the middle of all that chaos that I was to meet my mentor. His name was Jack Penrod. I was 16 years old, a valet parker at his beach club, Penrod's on the Beach. I didn't know it at the time. But he just appeared to be another person looking to park his car. And it just so happened that he came in in the early afternoon, driving a black Mercedes 300E model. He entered the driveway. All of the parking spots were numbered. He pulled into the first parking spot, which was labeled number one, directly beside my valet booth.
He got out of his car. And for some reason, I noticed some very interesting things about him. He was dressed like a businessman. But for some reason, his pants were a little short. He wasn't a tall man, but he had broad shoulders and strong arms. His hair combed back smoothly. A blazer on with a blue button-down with broad lapels on it. The pants were also flared a little bit. I'm not sure where he got that outfit from, but it wasn't quite American and it wasn't quite European either.
He looked at me and he said, "Good morning. How are you?" And I said, "I'm fine. How are you?" And he says, "Do you see that number on the floor?" And I said, "Yeah." And he says, "What is it?" And I said, "It says number one." And he says, "That's right. I'm number one. I'm Jack Penrod and I own the club. And this is my parking spot. So if you could be so kind as to put an orange cone here so that no other car ever parks in this spot, so that when I pull in here, my spot is always ready for me. If you think you could do that for me." And I said, "Yeah, sure. I'll do that."
I didn't know who he was until that moment. But I was bound to spend the next 40 years of my life working for him.
I found it curious that in those early days, I got to know him because he came in the parking lot. He wasn't quite frequent, and he was always curious. He wanted to know what my life was like and what the life of people my age and around me were experiencing. Like something that he had never experienced before or knew about or was unaccustomed with. It was an odd thing. But he was very interested in understanding the mentality of people my age. Because of that, we got to know each other over the next few years and became closer friends. We talked about trends and we talked about what young people like to do. We talked about music—not necessarily which bands were good and bad, but basically which trends were more popular. Was it country? Was it rock? I didn't know about alternative music because his daughter listened to alternative music and he didn't know what it was or the trend behind it. I found the conversations invigorating.
________________
It wasn't until about two years later that our relationship was strong enough that we actually started to do things together. By that time, I was 18 years old and I had been working in the parking lot for two years. I had joined a band playing alternative music in one of the clubs off of Sunrise Boulevard called the Reunion Room. It was a place where basically anybody under 21 years old could go if they paid the doorman an extra $5 and you could drink as much as you like and listen to alternative bands that were trending at the time—the Smiths, Nine Inch Nails, Modern English, music like that.
It was one day where Jack came into the parking lot and I had told him that I was working at my other job in the evening and he inquired what it was and I told him I was in a band and I was playing in an alternative club. And he says, "Well, you know, I thought about doing an alternative club and I have a space in Penrod's in the basement, but I don't think I could ever get anybody to go there." And I said, "Well, how about we go take a look at it?"
So together, we trucked on over to the club and he walked me down a set of stairs into the basement and he says, "You know, I didn't think I could do anything with this space because all the pipes are on the ceiling and they're exposed." And I said, "This is perfect. This is what alternative people like. Paint them neon orange and paint the rest of the walls black and put a stage over there and I think you could fill the place."
He looked at me skeptically and he says, "Well, the place that you play at, the Reunion Room, how many people go there?" And I responded, "I think we get about 300 people there every Thursday." He says, "So you play there every Thursday?" I said, "Yeah." And he says, "Well, and you bring those people." And I said, "Yes." And he says, "Well, how much they charge at the door?" I said, "10 dollars." He said, "Well, do you think they would come here?" I said, "Well, if you do what we just talked about, we can play here with our band and we can bring those customers here on an alternate night." And he says, "Well, what night would work?" I said, "Well, the alternative people like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesdays for some strange reason which I couldn't really explain."
But he believed me and decided that he was going to take a crack at it. So he brought his team of management around and engineering staff and said, "Here's what I'd like you to do." And they all had their ideas and contributed to developing a club called The Underground.
The next year, every Monday night, we would play and bring a good crowd of people to The Underground at the Penrod's Beach Club. Some famous bands came through there and played and it was an enjoyable experience. And to just put a carrot on top of it—The Underground was the place where I met my wife, which ironically happened to be my boss's daughter.

Jack was generous with us and paid us $3 per person we brought into the club. The club was a great experience and it continued for a period of time until the Penrod's Beach Club entity came to an end.
It was a tsunami of businesses closing—a tsunami of endings for most hotels and restaurateurs in the Fort Lauderdale Beach area during those late 80s. And the reason was simple: the city fathers had decided that the spring break era must come to an end in Fort Lauderdale. Too many incidents were occurring. The mayhem had become overarching. The antics were in the newspaper. Kids were coming to Fort Lauderdale and hurting themselves. Too much debauchery.
And so the city decided to tear up the road. And the aftermath was a lack of tourism, inability to drive up and down the road. And as a result, businesses started closing and crashing. A new directive was written for the future of Fort Lauderdale which included towers and hotels—towers and hotels for five-star services for a new elite, wealthy consumer—which took the next decade to develop a version of Fort Lauderdale for an older, more mature clientele.

Over the course of the next 38 years I would follow in Jack's footsteps, in his shadow, as we traversed across a myriad of landscapes developing beach clubs locally and in far away distant lands where operational control was tied together by phone calls and emails along with frequent trips—breaking down language barriers, service, customs, financial barriers, taxation, tax compliance, personalities, ego, shadows, righteous, selfish, and criminal.
The terrain was expansive and we were a small family from Florida. Not bilingual. With operational experiences from McDonald's. It was an experience breathtaking and sometimes absolutely horrendous.

CHAPTER 2: The View from the Street
During my tenure as Director of Global Operations, we had the opportunity to open many different properties. Some were successful. Some were not. And to be honest, my part was fairly limited in many of them—most certainly in the selection process during the earlier years. The drive for scalability was handled by other parties in our company. But to be a bystander, to have minimal influence while having the opportunity to watch and receive feedback from people on the ground—that was enormous. It was an education you couldn't buy. You pack away these little tidbits of information, and they stay with you, and they matter when it comes time to pick your next location.
Jack had a particular style about him when it came to assessments.
In one instance, I had just finished redesigning a club. I was proud of the work and eager for the review that would generally follow. The process was always the same: Jack would fly into the country, come to the property, and walk every inch of the operation, checking the modifications and reviewing the details.
This time, I was anxiously waiting at the entrance for his arrival. I expected that we would walk in together and start looking at everything I'd done. But when his car pulled up and he stepped out, he didn't walk toward the club. He started walking the other way—out of the driveway, across the street.
I followed him, confused. We crossed the road and walked about a hundred yards up the block in silence. Finally, I asked, "What are we doing?"
He turned around. Almost like enough time had lapsed, enough footsteps had been taken, the distance from the club just right for the lesson to land. He looked at me and said, "When you build a club, you don't start an assessment from inside the club. You start from the perspective of the customer—and what the customer sees from the street."
Then he turned back toward the property and said, "Okay. How visible is the signage? How big is the signage? Which direction is the signage pointing?"
I was flabbergasted. I had never taken this perspective on club development. Not once. And in hindsight, I thought about some of our other properties—particularly in France—that were nearly impossible to find. A tiny sign on a tree with an arrow. Almost like something out of a Leonardo DiCaprio movie, this hidden jewel that you had to know about to discover. And in those cases, the obscurity was part of the appeal. That was the brand.
But the lesson was bigger than signage. It was about understanding what makes a brand special, and how every decision—from the street view to the secret entrance—either reinforces or erodes it.
By the time Jack and I had finished building out a proper program for evaluating new locations, it included far more than geography. We assessed the direction of the wind. At what time of day would the sun drop behind buildings and cast shade across the property—and how would that affect revenue? What was the quality of the sand? The clarity of the ocean? Who were the tourists, and just as importantly, who were the locals? What were their customs, their habits, their expectations?
After years of doing this—assessing location after location across continents—I reached a point where I could look at a new territory and tell you within a hundred thousand dollars how that property would perform in its first year. And because of that, there were many properties we simply had to say no to. The customer demographic wasn't right. The economics weren't sustainable. The brand didn't belong there.
Which brings me to a harder lesson: what happens when you ignore all of that.
________________
I can give you an example. We decided to open a beach club on a particular Caribbean island. The spot was up and coming—at least we thought so—and we went in based on the encouragement of our financial partners to establish a position in the market.
We pursued it vigorously. Built a beautiful club on the coast. Magnificent water. A fantastic manager—one of our best. A world-class menu. In the early months, customers would fly in from the city by helicopter. Richard Branson came. Others like him followed.
But the property was not close to any populated area. It was out of the way, and from a geographical standpoint, it was a risky acquisition on every front. Sometimes getting ahead of a market can work—if tourism is growing, if development is coming, if there's a local base that can sustain you while the area catches up to your vision. But if that growth doesn't happen in tandem with your investment, you're exposed.
As the months went on and summer arrived, revenue dropped significantly. Our manager did what any good manager would do—he organized events, he tried to attract the local market. But then we discovered the problem.
Less than half a mile away, there was a local who had been operating his own club for thirty-five years. Every morning, he'd cast a lobster trap, haul in the day's catch fresh, and sell lobster for four dollars a pound. The locals clamored for it. It was a great meal at a great price, from a man they'd known their whole lives.
Our establishment—an upscale operation charging twenty times that amount for a lobster dish—simply could not compete. Not on price. Not on loyalty. Not on authenticity.
The effects were devastating. After months of suppression by a market that was never going to adopt us, the club closed.
The lesson was more than evident. We had damaged a relationship with an investor who was overly confident in their own marketplace. We had spent enormous time and energy developing a market that was never going to contribute to our global return. And worst of all, we had burned the energy of good people—talented operators—on a product they ultimately had to walk away from.
The problem wasn't the manager. It wasn't the menu or the music or the service. The problem was a decision made much earlier in the process: to build in a location that was not fitting for the brand.
That is the signal. That is the warning sign. When an operation starts chasing revenue by changing its identity—bringing in knockoff UB40 cover bands to appease a market you shouldn't have entered in the first place—you've already lost. The misalignment didn't happen on the ground. It happened at the top, long before anyone poured the first drink.
